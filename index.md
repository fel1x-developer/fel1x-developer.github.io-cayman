# fel1x's Development Status

## Info
I was born in Seoul, South Korea in 2007. I can speak five languages(which I think my greatest merit) and I am interested in various areas of programming, such as OS programming, game programming, frontend programming, backend programming, mobile programming, etc. Although I want to use my whole time in programming, I don't have much time for it because I am still a student.

## Thoughts on Programming
 - I focus on **stability**, **security**, **performance**, and **convinence**.
 - I don't prefer adwares since it interferes the users from experiencing the best UX. Instead, I advocate that **paid apps** and **subscriptions** are the best ways that a developer can earn from their apps.

## List of My Programming Languages

- C
- C++
- Swift
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- MySQL/MariaDB

I learned C first and now I think it was a smart choice since most programming languages are based on C. I then learned C++ which I use in game programming. Currently, I stopped game programming and learning SwiftUI to make a vocacbulary notebook on iOS.
